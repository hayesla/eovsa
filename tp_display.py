# tp_display routines

#     First written.
#   2014-Dec-20  DG
#     Fixed problems with display of nonuniform image data in 
#     tsys_show_dynspec(), especially the time axis.
#   2015-Apr-10  DG
#     Fixed a problem introduced earlier where I converted out['ut'] to
#     integer, which killed the date plotting.  I covert it back to float
#     now in tsys_show_dynspec()
#   2015-Apr-18  DG
#     In tsys_show_dynspec(), subtract day1 instead of using % 1 to allow
#     times to span a day.  This is still not entirely satisfactory,
#     and a considerable rewrite of date/time code is necessary
#   2015-May-29  DG
#      Converted from using datime() to using Time() based on astropy
#   2015-Jun-02  DG
#      Greatly simplified to just call the offline.py routines, which anyway
#      were the same.
