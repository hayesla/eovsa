'''
   Module for retrieving RSTN/Penticton quiet Sun flux densities and evaluating
   expected solar flux densities expected for 2.1-m antennas, as a function of 
   frequency. '''
#
# History:
#  2014-Dec-13  DG
#    Written earlier, but updated for changes to NOAA ftp location and new
#    archive file with dates older than 45 days.  Also added lots of error-handling.
#  2015-May-29  DG
#    Converted from using datime() to using Time() based on astropy
#  2016-May-07  DG
#    All of a sudden, closing a urlopen() file handle is hanging, so skip it.
#

        in the Time() object t.  Reads from file handle f, if supplied, or else
        attempts to retrieve the data from NOAA if the date is within 45 days of today.
        Otherwise, defaults to archive file /common/tmp/txt/radioflux.noa.  Under certain
        conditions, the routine calls itself after setting recur to True.
        
        On success, returns a 9-element list of frequencies and 
                            a 9-element list of corresponding flux densities
        
        On failure, returns None, None
